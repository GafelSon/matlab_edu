Welcome to the **MATLAB Project Repository**! This repository contains MATLAB scripts, functions, and resources for numerical computations, data analysis, visualization, and much more.

## Features
- **Numerical Computations**: Perform advanced mathematical calculations with ease.
- **Data Visualization**: Create 2D and 3D plots to represent data effectively.
- **Algorithm Development**: Experiment with algorithms for machine learning, signal processing, and optimization.
- **Custom Tools**: Build reusable functions and scripts for MATLAB workflows.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matlab-project.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Run the scripts or functions as needed.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2020a or later (some features may require additional toolboxes like Simulink or Image Processing).
